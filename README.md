# backfire-dot-php

# !!!THIS REPOSITORY HAS EXPLICIT CONTENT!!! YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.

This is a slur filter. Instead of banning users, this file will backfire at them. 
Here's the idea... 
The word "faggot" will turn into...
"I want someone of the same gender to slip me some tongue and fuck me in the ass with a rubber dick" 
But if we want to get more artistic, this file will turn "I don't like him because he's faggot" into... 
"I don't like him because I want someone of the same gender to slip me some tongue and fuck me in the ass with a rubber dick". 
We as an audience won't be able to see the look on there faces, but will know it will affect them deep down. 
Yes, we're assholes. But the kind that won't tolerate dickheads. 

To use these files, link backfire.php to the file you've made for your website. We've linked multiple PHP files to that file for an obvious reason. 

This may make us sound like Liberal Snowflakes, but we need this to be as gender neutral as possible so it will be AI-like (not real AI). If you look at backfire-en.php closely, you should be able to get the idea. 

We are in need of individuals who know languages other than English. Da140n has made a "list" in the file backfire.php. Whatever language you use, please put them in 'backfire-dot-php/lang/'. If you are fluent with both English AND your language, or the other way around, we definitely want you to join.
